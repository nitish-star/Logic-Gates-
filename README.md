# Interactive Logic Gates Simulator

An interactive web application for learning and experimenting with digital logic gates. This project provides a visual and hands-on approach to understanding basic logic gate operations.

## Preview

## Features

- **Interactive Logic Gates:**
  - AND Gate
  - OR Gate
  - NOT Gate
  - NAND Gate
  - NOR Gate
  - XOR Gate
  - XNOR Gate

- **Real-time Interaction:**
  - Click inputs to toggle between 1 (TRUE) and 0 (FALSE)
  - Instant output visualization
  - Color-coded states (Green for TRUE, Red for FALSE)

- **User Interface:**
  - Clean, modern design
  - Responsive layout
  - Side navigation menu
  - Dark/Light theme toggle
  - Interactive SVG gate diagrams

- **Educational Features:**
  - Truth tables for each gate
  - Detailed gate descriptions
  - Visual input/output representation
  - Clear instructions and legend

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (Vanilla)
- SVG for gate visualization

## How to Use

1. Open the application in a web browser
2. Use the menu button in the top-left corner to navigate between different gates
3. Click on input boxes to toggle between 1 (TRUE) and 0 (FALSE)
4. Observe how the output changes based on the gate's logic
5. View truth tables and descriptions by clicking the respective buttons
6. Toggle between dark and light themes using the theme button

## Gate Operations

- **AND Gate:** Output is TRUE only when all inputs are TRUE
- **OR Gate:** Output is TRUE if at least one input is TRUE
- **NOT Gate:** Inverts the input
- **NAND Gate:** Inverted AND operation
- **NOR Gate:** Inverted OR operation
- **XOR Gate:** Output is TRUE when inputs are different
- **XNOR Gate:** Output is TRUE when inputs are the same

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nitish-star/Logic-Gates-.git
   ```
2. Open `logic_gates2.0.html` in a web browser
   - Or use a local development server (like Live Preview in VS Code)
